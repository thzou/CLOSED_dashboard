## Installation

Please install [Python Poetry][https://python-poetry.org/].
Then simply run (inside the project directory):

```
poetry install
```

## Usage

If you want to use the dashboard as it is please use the below folder taxonomy of your 3D point clouds files. Then simply run ```poetry run python dashboard.py``` inside the project directory.

If you use the [Torch-Points 3D][https://github.com/torch-points3d/torch-points3d] framework for running deep learning models for 3D point cloud analysis, then you can change the path of ```DIR``` and ```benchmark_dir``` inside the ```dashboard.py``` to match the benchmark directory of your runs and run ```poetry run python dashboard.py``` inside the project directory.
